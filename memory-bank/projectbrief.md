# Project Brief: To-Do List Web Application

## 1. Overview
Develop a web-based To-Do List application running on a local XAMPP environment. The application will feature multi-user support with authentication, comprehensive task management (CRUD), and a responsive user interface inspired by Apple's design aesthetics (minimalist, elegant, smooth animations).

## 2. Core Requirements
- **Environment**: Localhost (XAMPP)
- **Technology Stack**:
    - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or jQuery)
    - Backend: PHP (7.4+)
    - Database: MySQL (5.7+)
- **Database Structure**:
    - `users` table (id, username, password, email, created_at)
    - `tasks` table (id, user_id, title, description, status, priority, created_at, due_date)
- **Key Features**:
    - User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout) with session management and password hashing (bcrypt).
    - Task Management (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via AJAX.
    - Task Filtering and Searching.
    - Responsive Design (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
    - Apple-inspired UI/UX (specific colors, typography, components, animations).
- **Security**: Input sanitization (prepared statements), CSRF protection.

## 3. Project Goal
To create a functional, secure, and aesthetically pleasing To-Do List application that adheres to the specified technical and design requirements, deployable on a local XAMPP server.
