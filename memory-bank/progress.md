# Progress: To-Do List Web Application

## 1. Current Status
- **Overall**: Core functionality implemented, UI refinement in progress.
- **Memory Bank**: Core files created and updated.
- **Database**: Schema defined, assumed created by user. Connection configured.
- **File Structure**: Project directories and core files created.
- **Features Implemented**:
    - User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout - Backend & Frontend Logic)
    - Task Management API (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Task Management Frontend (Add, View, Edit Modal, Delete, Complete/Pending via AJAX)
    - Filtering (by Status via Sidebar Links) & Searching (by Keyword)
    - Basic Responsive Layout (Desktop w/ Sidebar, Tablet/Mobile adjustments)
    - Basic Animations (Task Load, Delete Fade, Complete Line-through, Custom Checkbox, Button Loading)
    - Initial Apple-inspired Styling (Forms, Buttons, Cards, Modal, Header, Sidebar)
    - Header Blur Effect on Scroll
    - Sidebar Integration (Stats, Status Filters, Search)
- **Features Remaining/Refinements**:
    - Fix Task Card Meta Layout (Priority/Due Date alignment) - **Current Blocker**
    - Advanced Animations (Optional: Button ripple, more complex transitions)
    - Advanced UI (Optional: Mobile touch gestures)
    - Security Hardening (Optional: CSRF Protection)
    - Documentation (User Guide, Developer Docs update in README.md)
    - Thorough Testing & Debugging

## 2. What Works
- User registration, login, logout.
- Adding new tasks.
- Viewing tasks (pending/completed sections).
- Marking tasks complete/pending (with custom checkbox).
- Deleting tasks (with confirmation and animation).
- Editing tasks via modal.
- Filtering tasks by status (using sidebar links).
- Searching tasks by keyword.
- Basic responsive layout adjustments.
- Header blur effect.
- Sidebar statistics display.
- Button loading indicators.

## 3. What's Left to Build
- **High Priority**: Fix task card meta layout.
- **Optional**:
    - CSRF Protection.
    - Advanced animations/UI (touch gestures, etc.).
    - Update README.md documentation.
- **Ongoing**: Testing and bug fixing.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers
- **Task Card Layout**: Priority and Due Date in the meta section are not correctly aligned (Priority left, Due Date right). Needs CSS fix.
- **Login PDO Issue (Resolved)**: Encountered and fixed `SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number` error by using a two-step query.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
- Created Memory Bank files first.
- Confirmed project structure directly within `c:/xampp/htdocs/To-Do`.
- Confirmed database name `todo_app_db`.
- Resolved login PDO error by splitting username/email check into two queries.
- Integrated status filters into sidebar navigation links instead of separate dropdowns.
- Skipped mobile touch gestures due to complexity.
