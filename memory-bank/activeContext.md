# Active Context: To-Do List Web Application (Initialization)

## 1. Current Focus
- **Verify Task Card Layout**: Confirm the layout with Due Date below actions, pushed down with `margin-top: 25px`, is correct visually.
- **User Testing**: Proceed with testing all features once layout is confirmed.
- Potential minor refinements based on testing feedback.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Added FontAwesome icons to sidebar navigation links (`dashboard.php`).
- Added CSS for icon spacing in sidebar links (`style.css`).
- **Restructured Task Card Layout**:
    - Modified `assets/js/tasks.js` (`createTaskElement`) to move the due date span out of `.task-meta` and into a new wrapper (`.action-due-date`) within `.task-card-actions`.
    - Updated `assets/css/style.css` to style the date below actions, including setting `margin-top: 25px` on `.action-due-date`. Fixed previous syntax errors using `write_to_file`.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate Plan)
1.  **Verify Task Card Layout**: Visually check the layout: Priority in `.task-meta`, Actions (buttons/checkbox) and Due Date (below actions, right-aligned, pushed down) in `.task-card-actions`.
2.  **User Testing**: Test all features (authentication, task CRUD, filtering, search, responsiveness, animations).
3.  **Security Hardening (Optional)**: Implement CSRF protection if requested.
4.  **Final Debugging**.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Database Naming**: `todo_app_db`.
- **Database Creation**: Assumed complete by user.
- **Directory Structure**: Project root is `c:/xampp/htdocs/To-Do`.
- **Technology Choice**: Sticking to Vanilla JS for now, as requested, unless specific complexities arise that warrant jQuery.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Follow the Apple-inspired design guidelines meticulously during frontend development.
- Prioritize secure coding practices (PDO prepared statements, password hashing).
- Use AJAX for all task-related CRUD operations to ensure a smooth UX.

## 6. Learnings & Insights
- The user provided a very comprehensive specification, which is helpful for planning.
- Establishing the Memory Bank first provides a clear documentation trail from the start.
