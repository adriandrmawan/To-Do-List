# Active Context: To-Do List Web Application (Initialization)

## 1. Current Focus
- Final testing and potential minor refinements based on user feedback.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Refined CSS focus styles for form inputs/textareas in `style.css`.
- Refined CSS active state styles for buttons in `style.css`.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate Plan)
1.  **User Testing**: User to test the current functionality (Auth, CRUD, Filtering, Responsiveness, Basic Animations, Styling Refinements).
2.  **Implement Advanced Animations (Optional)**: Apply remaining specified animations (e.g., custom checkbox, button loading state).
3.  **Implement Advanced UI (Optional)**: Add desktop sidebar, header blur effect.
4.  **Security Hardening (Optional)**: Implement CSRF protection.
5.  **Final Debugging**.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Database Naming**: Confirmed as `todo_app_db`.
- **Database Creation**: User needs SQL commands for DB and tables.
- **Directory Structure**: Confirmed: Create project structure directly within `c:/xampp/htdocs/To-Do` (no `todo-app` subfolder).
- **Technology Choice**: Sticking to Vanilla JS for now, as requested, unless specific complexities arise that warrant jQuery.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Follow the Apple-inspired design guidelines meticulously during frontend development.
- Prioritize secure coding practices (PDO prepared statements, password hashing).
- Use AJAX for all task-related CRUD operations to ensure a smooth UX.

## 6. Learnings & Insights
- The user provided a very comprehensive specification, which is helpful for planning.
- Establishing the Memory Bank first provides a clear documentation trail from the start.
