# Active Context: To-Do List Web Application (Initialization)

## 1. Current Focus
- Implementing UI/UX details based on Apple-inspired design specifications.
- Styling core components (header, forms, task cards).
- Implementing basic animations and responsiveness.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Implemented backend Task Management API (`api/tasks/create.php`, `read.php`, `update.php`, `delete.php`).
- Updated frontend JS (`assets/js/tasks.js`) to handle task CRUD operations via AJAX (add, load, display, delete, toggle status).

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate Plan)
1.  **Style Core Pages**: Apply base styles and layout to `login.php`, `register.php`, and `dashboard.php` using `assets/css/style.css`.
2.  **Style Task Cards**: Implement the Apple-inspired design for task cards in `style.css`.
3.  **Implement Modals**: Create HTML/CSS structure for modals (e.g., for editing tasks) and add JS logic to show/hide them.
4.  **Implement Task Editing**: Add edit button functionality in `tasks.js` to populate and submit the edit modal, calling the `update.php` API.
5.  **Implement Filtering/Searching**: Add UI controls and JS logic.
6.  **Implement Animations**: Apply CSS/JS animations as specified.
7.  **Refine Responsiveness**: Add media queries and adjust layouts for different screen sizes.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Database Naming**: Confirmed as `todo_app_db`.
- **Database Creation**: User needs SQL commands for DB and tables.
- **Directory Structure**: Confirmed: Create project structure directly within `c:/xampp/htdocs/To-Do` (no `todo-app` subfolder).
- **Technology Choice**: Sticking to Vanilla JS for now, as requested, unless specific complexities arise that warrant jQuery.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Follow the Apple-inspired design guidelines meticulously during frontend development.
- Prioritize secure coding practices (PDO prepared statements, password hashing).
- Use AJAX for all task-related CRUD operations to ensure a smooth UX.

## 6. Learnings & Insights
- The user provided a very comprehensive specification, which is helpful for planning.
- Establishing the Memory Bank first provides a clear documentation trail from the start.
