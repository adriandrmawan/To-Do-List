# Active Context: To-Do List Web Application (Initialization)

## 1. Current Focus
- Final testing and potential minor refinements based on user feedback.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Implemented staggered loading animation for task cards in `assets/js/tasks.js`.
- Implemented fade-out animation on task deletion in `assets/js/tasks.js`.
- Implemented line-through animation for completed task titles in `assets/js/tasks.js`.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate Plan)
1.  **User Testing**: User to test the current functionality (Auth, CRUD, Filtering, Responsiveness, Basic Animations).
2.  **Refinements (Optional)**: Address any bugs or minor UI tweaks based on testing.
3.  **Consider Advanced Features**: Decide whether to implement further features like header blur, sidebar, more animations, touch gestures, CSRF protection based on user priority.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Database Naming**: Confirmed as `todo_app_db`.
- **Database Creation**: User needs SQL commands for DB and tables.
- **Directory Structure**: Confirmed: Create project structure directly within `c:/xampp/htdocs/To-Do` (no `todo-app` subfolder).
- **Technology Choice**: Sticking to Vanilla JS for now, as requested, unless specific complexities arise that warrant jQuery.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Follow the Apple-inspired design guidelines meticulously during frontend development.
- Prioritize secure coding practices (PDO prepared statements, password hashing).
- Use AJAX for all task-related CRUD operations to ensure a smooth UX.

## 6. Learnings & Insights
- The user provided a very comprehensive specification, which is helpful for planning.
- Establishing the Memory Bank first provides a clear documentation trail from the start.
