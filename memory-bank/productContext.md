# Product Context: To-Do List Web Application

## 1. Problem Solved
Provides a digital solution for users to manage their tasks efficiently, replacing potentially scattered notes or mental lists. It allows multiple users to maintain their own private task lists within the same application instance.

## 2. Target User
Individuals needing a personal task management tool accessible via a web browser on their local machine (using XAMPP).

## 3. How It Should Work (User Experience)
- **Intuitive Interface**: Users should find it easy to register, log in, and manage their tasks without needing extensive instructions.
- **Seamless Task Management**: Adding, viewing, editing, completing, and deleting tasks should be quick and performed without full page reloads (using AJAX).
- **Clear Organization**: Tasks should be clearly displayed, grouped by status (pending/completed), and sortable/filterable by priority, deadline, etc.
- **Aesthetically Pleasing**: The UI should be clean, modern, and visually appealing, drawing inspiration from Apple's design language (minimalism, clear typography, subtle animations).
- **Responsive**: The application must adapt smoothly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), offering an optimized experience on each.
- **Feedback**: The application should provide clear visual feedback for actions (e.g., success messages, loading indicators, animations for task completion/deletion).

## 4. Key User Flows
- **Onboarding**: User registers an account -> Logs in -> Lands on their personal dashboard.
- **Task Creation**: User clicks 'Add Task' -> Fills out details in a modal/form -> Submits -> Task appears in the 'pending' list via AJAX.
- **Task Interaction**: User views tasks -> Clicks to edit -> Updates details in a modal -> Saves changes via AJAX.
- **Task Completion**: User clicks a checkbox -> Task status updates to 'completed' via AJAX -> Task visually moves or changes appearance (e.g., line-through, moves to 'completed' section).
- **Task Deletion**: User clicks 'delete' -> Confirms action -> Task is removed from the list via AJAX with an animation.
- **Filtering/Searching**: User selects filter options or types in search bar -> Task list updates in real-time.
- **Logout**: User clicks 'Logout' -> Session ends -> User is redirected to the login page.
